# OlympicGames_DataAnalysisProject_via_SQL_PowerBI
# Business Request
"As a data analyst working at a news company, I am asked to visualize data that will help readers understand how countries have performed historically in the summer Olympic Games. And also know that there is an interest in details about the competitors, so if you find anything interesting, donâ€™t hesitate to bring that in. 
The main task is still to show historical performance for different countries, with the possibility to select your own country."

# Data Cleansing & Transformation (SQL)
To create the necessary data model for doing analysis tables were extracted by using SQL.

# Olympic Games Dashboard (Power BI)
At the final of this project, I created one paged dashboard "Olympic Games Analysis" which shows the details about the competitors, the historical performance of different countries, and other interesting details.
